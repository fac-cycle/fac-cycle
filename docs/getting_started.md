# Getting started

## Frontend code
To run in development mode run: `npm run webpack-dev`

To build bundle.js run: `npm run webpack-build`

Webpack will serve the frontend code from port 4000.

## Backend code
To run backend code (reloads with nodemon): `npm run start-server`

The backend code will be served from port 3000 in development.

NOTE: if you're working on the frontend but need to make queries to the backend, you will also need to ensure the backend server is running as well.

## Running tests

To run the frontend tests run: `npm run test-src`

To run the backend tests run: `npm run test-server`
